# Desiderata

1. Object Capability Security – Access to objects in the Global State are granted using the Object Capability Security model.
2. Concurrency and Parallelism – The system must be efficient and performant, in particular this will be achieved via concurrent design enabling parallelism in key components.
3. CBC – The system must be "correct-by-construction" in as many aspects as possible. This includes using CBC Casper as the consensus protocol.
4. PoS – The system must use  proof-of-stake \(as opposed to proof-of-work\). The proof-of-stake system must be as decentralized as possible and avoid delegation.  
5. Developer Friendly – The system must be \(relatively\) easy to create dapps for. This includes sufficient libraries, documentation, tutorials and community support to enable development on the platform.
