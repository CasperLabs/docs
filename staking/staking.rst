The Staking Transaction
--------------------

The most secure way to send a transaction is to compile the contract and send the request to the network. 
Because the transaction authorizes the token to be locked into the auction contract, it's really important
to compile the contract yourself. Here are the steps to do this:


* Visit `Github <https://github.com/CasperLabs/casper-node>`_ and fork and clone the repository.
* Make sure that all dependencies are installed  (documented on GitHub).
* Follow the instructions to build the contracts.
* Create the transaction & deploy it.
* Check the status of the auction to see if your .

Build the Delegate Contract
----------------------

Clone the casper-node repository and build the contracts.
To build contracts, set up Rust & install all dependencies. Visit 'Setting up Rust' in the Developer Guide.

Build the contracts in release mode.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make setup-rs
   $ make build-client-contracts

Example Delegation Transaction
---------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   $ casper-client put-deploy --chain-name delta-10 --node-address http://localhost:7777 -k $HOME/secret_key.pem --session-path  $HOME/casper-node/target/wasm32-      unknown-unknown/release/delegate.wasm  --payment-amount 1000000000  --session-arg "validator:public_key=â€™PUBLIC_KEY_HEX'"   --session-arg="amount:u512='AMOUNT'"    --session-arg "delegator:public_key='DELEGATOR_PUBLIC_KEY_HEX'"


Delegation Arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The delegate contract accepts 3 arguments:

* delegator public key: The public key in hex of the account to delegate.  Note: This has to be the matching key to the secret key that signs the deploy.
* amount: This is the amount that is being delegated. 
* validator public key: The public key in hex of the validator that the stake will be delegated to.

Check the Status of the Transaction
-----------------------------------

Since this is a deployment like any other, it's possible to perform ``get-deploy`` using the client.

.. code-block:: bash

   casper-client get-deploy --node-address http://<HOST:PORT> <DEPLOY_HASH>

Which will return the status of execution.

Check the Status of the Validator and the Delegation
---------------------------------------------

If the bid wins the auction, the public key and associated bond amount (formerly bid amount) will appear in the auction contract as part of the 
validator set for a future era. To determine if the bid was accepted, query the auction contract via the rust ``casper-client``

.. code-block:: bash

   casper-client get-auction-info --node-address http://<HOST:PORT>

The request returns a response that looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

          "bonding_purse": "uref-5bbf1fe90097a59904f71005fd8f0beeabd0598a559617ec1dac75900b8e726a-007",

          },

  
Note the ``era_id`` and the ``validator_weights`` sections of the response. For a given ``era_id`` a set of validators is defined.  To determine the current era,
ping the ``/status`` endpoint of a validating node in the network.  This will return the current ``era_id``.  The current ``era_id`` will be listed in the auction
info response. If the public key associated with a bid appears in the ``validator_weights`` structure for an era, then the account is bonded in that era.

If the Bid doesn't win
----------------------

If your bid doesn't win a slot in the auction, it is because your bid is too low.  The resolution for this problem is to increase your bid amount.
It is possible to submit additional bids, to increase the odds of winning a slot. It is also possible to encourage token holders to delegate stake to 
you for bonding.

Withdrawing a Bid
-----------------

Follow the steps in `Unbonding <https://docs.casperlabs.io/en/latest/node-operator/unbonding.html>`_ to withdraw a bid.
