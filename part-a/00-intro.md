# Introduction

A consensus protocol is at the core of any blockchain technology. It dictates how a distributed set of trustless nodes comes to a coherent view of the world.

The consensus solution used in CasperLabs blockchain is a latest achievement of research path that can be traced back to the 1980's. Important milestones on this path were:

* 1980: The problem of byzantine consensus defined \(Lamport, Shostak\)
* 1985: Impossibility of distributed consensus with one faulty process theorem \(Fischer, Lynch, Paterson\)
* 1997: Proof-of-Work invented \(Hashcash system\)
* 1999: "Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance" \(PBFT\) algorithm \(Castro, Liskov\)
* 2008: Bitcoin invented \(Satoshi Nakamoto\)
* 2012: First proof-of-stake cryptocurrency system created \(Peercoin system\)
* 2013: Ethereum invented - cryptocurrency idea generalized to a decentralized general-purpose computing platform \(Vitalik Buterin\)
* 2013: "Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree" \(GHOST\) algorithm introduced \(Sompolinsky, Zohar\)
* 2015: Blockchain idea extended to "block DAG" - "Inclusive Block Chain Protocols" \(Lewenberg, Sompolinsky, Zohar\)
* 2017: First draft version of Casper protocol spec published \(Ethereum research group, Vlad Zamfir\)
* Jul 2018: First implementation of proof-of-stake blockchain built on Casper-GHOST-Blockdag combination attempted \(Rchain system\)
* Dec 2018: CBC Casper protocol 1.0 specification \(Ethereum research group, Vlad Zamfir\)
* Sep 2019: Leader-based CBC Casper (Daniel Kane, Vlad Zamfir, Andreas Fackler) 

The solution we present here is pretty complex. Therefore we introduce it step-by-step, starting from the simplest possible model first and then enriching the model gradually.
