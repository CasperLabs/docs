Execution Error Codes
=====================

This section covers smart contract execution error codes.

As mentioned in `Writing Rust Contracts <writing-rust-contracts.html#using-error-codes>`_\ , smart contracts can exit with an error code defined by an `ApiError <https://docs.rs/casper-types/latest/casper_types/enum.ApiError.html>`_.  Descriptions of each variant are found `here <https://docs.rs/casper-types/latest/casper_types/enum.ApiError.html#variants>`_ and include the following sub-types:


* `proof of stake errors <https://docs.rs/casper-types/latest/casper_types/system_contract_errors/pos/enum.Error.html>`_
* `mint errors <https://docs.rs/casper-types/latest/casper_types/system_contract_errors/mint/enum.Error.html>`_
* `custom user error code <https://docs.rs/casper-types/latest/casper_types/enum.ApiError.html#variant.User>`_

An ``ApiError`` of one of these sub-types maps to an exit code with an offset defined by the sub-type.  For example, an ``ApiError::User(2)`` maps to an exit code of ``65538`` (i.e. ``65536 + 2``\ ).  You can find a mapping from contract exit codes to ``ApiError`` variants `here <https://docs.rs/casper-types/latest/casper_types/enum.ApiError.html#mappings>`_.
