CasperLabs Contract DSL
====================

The DSL is a way to help developers avoid boilerplate code and express Smart Contracts in the easy way. 
This boilerplate code is repetitive and well structured, enabling the creation of a DSL that uses macros 
to create this boilerplate code which simplifies the creation and standardization of contracts.

The code will be a bit larger after the macros run and the boilerplate code is added into the contract. The macros operate like templates.  

The macros work with Contract Headers (released as part of the 0.20 release). 
Contracts created prior to 0.20 will need to be upgraded to use the macros.
