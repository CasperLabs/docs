Multi-Signature Tutorial
========================

In this tutorial, you will learn to use `Casper's permissions model <https://docs.casperlabs.io/en/latest/implementation/accounts.html#permissions-model>`_ to sign transactions with multiple keys. The code for this tutorial is available in `GitHub <https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/keys-manager>`_. The sample code creates a smart contract and a sample client that invokes the multi-signature feature on a local Casper network.
