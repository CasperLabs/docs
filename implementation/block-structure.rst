Block Structure
===============

.. _block-structure-intro:

Introduction
------------

A *block* is the primary data structure by which information about the state of the CasperLabs system is communicated between nodes of the network. We briefly describe here the format of this data structure.

.. _block-structure-proto:

Protobuf definition
-------------------

Messages between nodes are communicated using `Google’s protocol
buffers <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/>`__. The complete definition of a block in this format can be `found on
GitHub <https://github.com/CasperLabs/CasperLabs/blob/c78e35f4d8f0f7fd9b8cf45a4b17a630ae6ab18f/protobuf/io/casperlabs/casper/consensus/consensus.proto#L111>`__ ; the description here is only meant to provide an overview of the block format; the protobuf definition is authoritative.

Data fields
-----------

A block consists of the following:

-  a ``block_hash``
-  a header
-  a body
-  a signature

Each of these are detailed in the subsequent sections.

``block_hash``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``block_hash`` is the ``blake2b256`` hash of the header (serialized according to the protobuf specification).

Header
~~~~~~

The block header contains the following fields:

-  ``parent_hashes``

   -  a list of ``block_hash``\ s giving the parents of the block

-  justifications

   -  a list of ``block_hash``\ s givin the justifications of the block (see consensus
      description in part A for more details)

-  a summary of the global state, including

   -  the :ref:`root hash of the global state trie <global-state-trie>` prior to executing
      the deploys in this block (``pre_state_hash``)
   -  the root hash of the global state trie after executing the deploys in this
      block (``post_state_hash``)
   -  the list of currently bonded validators, and their stakes

-  the ``blake2b256`` hash of the body of the block (serialized according to the
   protobuf specification)
-  the time the block was created
-  the protocol version the block was executed with
-  the number of deploys in the block
-  the human-readable name corresponding to this instance of the CasperLabs
   system (``chain_id``)
-  the public key of the validator who created this block
-  an indicator for whether this message is intended as a true block, or merely a *ballot* (see consensus description in part A for more details)


Body
~~~~

The block body contains a list of the deploys processed as part of this block. A processed deploy contains the following information:

-  a copy of the `deploy
   message <https://github.com/CasperLabs/CasperLabs/blob/c78e35f4d8f0f7fd9b8cf45a4b17a630ae6ab18f/protobuf/io/casperlabs/casper/consensus/consensus.proto#L24>`__
   which was executed (see :ref:`Execution Semantics <execution-semantics-deploys>` for
   more information about deploys and how they are executed)
-  the :ref:`amount of gas spent <execution-semantics-gas>` during its execution
-  a flag indicating whether the deploy encountered an error
-  a string for an error message (if applicable)

Signature
~~~~~~~~~

The block signature cryptographically proves the block was created by the validator who’s public key is contained in the header. The signature is created using a specified algorithm (currently only `Ed25519 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519>`__ is supported), and is signed over the ``block_hash`` so that it is unique to that block.
