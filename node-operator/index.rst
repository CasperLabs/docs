Validators
==========

Validators that wish to run node infrastructure on the Casper network, either as a standalone private network, or as part of the public network should explore this guide.

It is recommended that you have prior knowledge of Unix-based operating systems and proficiency with systemd and bash scripting.  If you are unfamiliar with systemd, the `Arch Linux page on systemd <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd>`_ is a good intro to using it.
