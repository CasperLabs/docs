Introduction
============

Welcome to the CasperLabs project, implemented as a new permissionless, decentralized, public blockchain. Our open source Turing-complete smart contract platform is backed by a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, and WebAssembly (wasm). Our particular consensus protocol in the CBC Casper family, built on Vlad Zamfirâ€™s correct-by-construction (CBC) Casper work, is provably safe and live under partial synchrony without an in-protocol fault tolerance threshold.
