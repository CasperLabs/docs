# Introduction

Welcome to dApp development with CasperLabs! We are excited to have the opportunity to share this guide introducing our contract development kit with a groundbreaking toolset designed to support you on your journey to developing dApps with our platform features, including but not limited to:

- Our virtual runtime environment (Execution Engine (EEVM))
- Rust libraries, reference documentation, and test framework
- Sample preview of our AssemblyScript contract development library (to be released early this Spring 2020).

With this guide we hope to facilitate your understanding about the CasperLabs features so that you can easily build and operate your own applications on the platform with our ever evolving dApp development capabilities.
