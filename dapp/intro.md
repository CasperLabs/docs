Introduction
============

Welcome to the CasperLabs project, implemented as a new permissionless, decentralized, public blockchain. Our open source Turing-complete smart contract platform is backed by a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, and WebAssembly (wasm). Our particular consensus protocol in the CBC Casper family, built on Vlad Zamfirâ€™s correct-by-construction (CBC) Casper work, is provably safe and live under partial synchrony without an in-protocol fault tolerance threshold.

Read our [Tech Spec](https://techspec.casperlabs.io/en/latest/) to Learn more about what we're building so you can become a contributor.

## Purpose of this guide

This document highlights the set of our core documentation prioritized for you to get started with our platform so that you can install our environment locally, create and test Smart contracts with our Smart Contracts and Test Libraries, and use these libraries to build your own applications.

## Who is this guide for
This documentation is intended for members of our Community who build DApps using our CasperLabs features.

## How this guide is organized

This documentation is accessed here and located on our GitHub repository, the single source of truth for all Smart Contract Developer documentation. The topics on the index include present and future documentation initiatives in our roadmap.

Documentation is provided for you so that you will be able to:

##### Understand what CasperLabs is building and how you can build your applications
##### Learn how to build and operate applications on the platform
##### Learn how to set up the CasperLabs environment locally
##### Learn how to create and test Smart Contracts with our Libraries
##### Work with our Contracts API to access our Rust resources


## Background
The motivation for this roadmap is inspired by feedback we are receiving from your recommendations. We hope you continue to provide your feedback as you embark on this journey with us -- we look forward to building a decentralized future together.
