Introduction
============

Welcome to the CasperLabs project, implemented as a new permissionless decentralized, public blockchain. Our open source Turing-complete smart contract platform is backed by a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, and WebAssembly (Wasm). Our particular consensus protocol in the CBC Casper family, built on Vlad Zamfirâ€™s correct-by-construction (CBC) Casper work, is provably safe and live under partial synchrony without an in-protocol fault tolerance threshold.

Read our [Tech Spec](https://techspec.casperlabs.io/en/latest/) to learn more about what we're building and become a community contributor.

## Purpose of this guide

This guide is designed to support dApp developers getting started with the development of smart contracts on the CasperLabs blockchain with AssemblyScript contracts, and a Rust contract development kit that includes a runtime environment, reference documentation, and test framework.

## Who is this guide for

This documentation is intended for members of our Community who build distributed applications (dApps), smart contracts using our CasperLabs platform features. You can install our environment locally, create and test Smart Contracts with our Smart Contracts and Test Libraries, and use these libraries to build your own applications.

## What you need to know

It is recommended you have prior knowledge about:

* Linux or OSx
* Programming knowledge
  * JavaScript and/or Python
  * Rust and/or Assembly script.

## How this guide is organized

This documentation is accessed here and located on our [GitHub](https://github.com/CasperLabs/techspec) repository, the single source of truth for all Smart Contract Developer documentation. The topics on the index include present and future documentation initiatives in our roadmap and are organized so that you will be able to:

- Understand what CasperLabs is building and how you can build your applications
- Learn how to build and operate applications on the platform
- Learn how to set up the CasperLabs environment locally
- Learn how to create and test Smart Contracts with our Libraries
- Work with our Contracts API to access our Rust resources.

See the [overview](getting-started.md) and [instructions](instructions.md) for Getting Started in this guide.

## Background

The motivation for our roadmap is inspired by feedback we are receiving from your recommendations. We hope you continue to provide your feedback as you embark on this journey with us -- we look forward to building a decentralized future together.

## Coding Standards

[Coding Standards and Review](https://github.com/CasperLabs/CasperLabs/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) cover best practices and recommendations following our coding standards, code reviews and publishing your code to our GitHub.
