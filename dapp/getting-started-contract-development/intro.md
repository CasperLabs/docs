This guide supports the development of smart contracts on the CasperLabs blockchain enabling developers to run smart contracts in the CasperLabs runtime environment included with our CasperLabs contract development kit as follows:

- [System (Genesis) contracts](https://github.com/CasperLabs/CasperLabs/tree/master/execution-engine/contracts/system) - to bond to the network
- [Example contracts](https://github.com/CasperLabs/CasperLabs/tree/master/execution-engine/contracts/examples) - smart contract examples (e.g., ERC20, Vesting, etc.)
- [Integration tests](...) - to test and debug smart contract examples

You will be able to run smart contracts in the [CasperLabs environment](https://clarity.casperlabs.io/#/) and choose to use tools you are familiar with to build your contracts and run them in the runtime environment in the order you desire and so observe the effects of contract execution in the [global state](https://techspec.casperlabs.io/en/latest/implementation/global-state.html) (the shared database that is the blockchain) -all from within an IDE of your choice.

With this Kit Using you will be able to build, debug, deploy contracts using our CasperLabs environment and an IDE of your choice for the following scenarios:

- the CasperLabs Network
- a network of your choice
- locally

#### Supported Operating Systems

- Unix
- Mac OS
- Windows
- Docker

## Supported Languages to build contracts
We support building smart contracts with libraries provided for the following languages.

- [Rust](...) A Rust library for writing smart contracts on the [CasperLabs Platform](https://techspec.casperlabs.io/).
- [Assemblyscript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) Typescript  Library
  - [Truffle](...)

## What you need to know

- Linux or OSx
- Programming knowledge
  - JavaScript and/or Python

## What you will discover

  [How contracts are built and how they work with the platform](https://github.com/CasperLabs/CasperLabs/tree/release-v0.12/execution-engine/contracts/examples)

Contracts are written in supported languages and compiled with WASM.
