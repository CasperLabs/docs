# Introduction

This guide is designed to support dApp developers getting started with the development of smart contracts on the CasperLabs blockchain with a contract development kit that includes a runtime environment, reference documentation, test framework that supports Rust, and a library that supports developing dApps with AssemblyScript.

- Understand what CasperLabs is building and how you can build your applications
- Learn how to build and operate applications on the platform
- Learn how to set up the CasperLabs environment locally
- Learn how to create and test Smart Contracts with our Libraries
- Work with our Contracts API to access our Rust resources.

## Who is this guide for
