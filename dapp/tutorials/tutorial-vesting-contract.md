# Vesting contract tutorial

The implementation of a vesting smart contract for Casperlabs allows you to lock in some tokens to be given after some set time frame.

The CasperLabs vesting smart contract is organized in two parts -- 

-  the smart contract layer that uses the contract logic and 
- a smart contract test that allows you to test your contract

This contract provides for:

With some CLX tokens, you can lock in some tokens (motes) to give to someone after a set time (see parameters below). So that 

- a user can withdraw the number of tokens after a set time 

- allocate a "drip amount" whereby, over a time period a user can periodically retrieve a given amount, after which the tokens are no longer available, e.g. 15 tokens daily for 1 month 

The `admin_release_duration` function defines a time frame whereby an admin can take back the amount after the set time elapses.
