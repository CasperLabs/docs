# Vesting contract tutorial

The implementation of a vesting smart contract for Casperlabs allows you to lock in some tokens to be given after some set time frame.

The CasperLabs vesting smart contract is organized in two parts:

- the smart contract layer that uses the contract logic and
- a smart contract test that allows you to test your contract

- you can allocate an amount from your, e.g. CLX tokens (motes) to someone after a set time frame, so that a given user may withdraw the amount when it is made available

- set a "drip amount" to be allocated over a period of time, after which the tokens are no longer available, e.g. 15 tokens daily for 1 month, so that a user can periodically retrieve the allocated amount until the time frame has expired

Note: The `admin_release_duration` function defines a time frame whereby an admin can take back the amount after the set time elapses.
