Deploying contracts
===================


How to structure your deployments
---------------------------------

You can Deploy contracts using our pre-built binaries or build from source. Both provide the casperLabs-client.

**Using binaries** (recommended):
Install rustup and the casperlabs package, which contains casperlabs-client.

**Building from source**
Install rustup and Build the casperlabs-client.
If you build from source, you will need to add the build directories to your PATH
Or you can run the client commands from the root directory of the repo, using explicit paths to the binaries.

See Deploying Contracts [here](https://github.com/CasperLabs/CasperLabs/blob/v0.14.0/docs/CONTRACTS.md)
