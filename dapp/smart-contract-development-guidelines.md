Contract authors can write their smart contracts in Rust with some degree of confidence. We have language bindings in Rust and you can view source code examples in our GIT repository. The module is supposed to be a wrapper around a separate Rust process for smart contracts execution.

All our Rust crates are published on crates.io where you can see the latest [CasperLabs Rust docs](https://crates.io/search?q=casperlabs)
