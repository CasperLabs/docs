ERC20 Tutorial
===============================

The following includes a set of tutorials with step-by-step examples to guide you through basic and advanced features for implementing the CasperLabs ERC20  for creating tokens by smart contract, managing, and testing them using the CasperLabs development framework. We will go through the steps to prepare the ERC20 environment, provide and test the logic, and run and deploy the contract to Devnet.

We highly recommended reading `Writing Rust Contracts on CasperLabs <../writing-rust-contracts.html>`_. 

Though most smart contract developers are familiar with the ERC20, we highly recommend you take the opportunity to carefully read through the following:
 
 Etherium [ERC-20 Token Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md#)(Ethereum Request For Comments and 20). It provides for the definition of methods we'll be implementing.
 
 We also recommend familiarity with our introduction to developing dapps with CasperLabs covered in `Writing Rust Contracts on CasperLabs <../writing-rust-contracts.html>`_.

Note: Completed code is found on our Github `CasperLabs/erc20 <https://github.com/CasperLabs/erc20>`_.
