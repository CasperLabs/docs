ERC20 Tutorial
===============================

The following includes a guided tutorial for implementing the CasperLabs ERC20. We will go through the steps to prepare the ERC20 environment, provide and test the logic, and run and deploy the contract to Devnet.

We highly recommended reading `Writing Rust Contracts on CasperLabs <../writing-rust-contracts.html>`_. 

Note: Completed code is available on our Github `CasperLabs/erc20 <https://github.com/CasperLabs/erc20>`_.
