## About ERC20

From a high-level, the ERC20 standard, the foundation upon which the CasperLabs ERC20 is implemented, is a well established standard originating from the Ethereum ecosystem. Most Smart contract developers familiar with ERC20 use this standard to create tokens for their own implementations.

The following provides step-by-step examples to guide you through basic and advanced features of our ERC20 implementation on our blockchain using the CasperLabs development framework.

Our methods allow for the provision and transfer tokens to be approved for spending by third party stakeholders, and used by other decentralized applications, e.g. purses, etc..

- `balance_of`
- `transfer`
- `total_supply`
- `approve`
- `allowance`
- `transfer_from`
- `mint`

- Preparation - setting up your erc20 project and libary
- Logic - modifying the environment for methods we use
- Testing - setting up and running erc20 tests in our test framework
- Usage - working with the erc20 contract on our devnet

Note: Though most smart contract developers are familiar with the ERC20, we highly recommend before starting the tutorials you take advantage of this opportunity to carefully read through the Etherium [ERC-20 Token Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md#)
