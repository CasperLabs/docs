CL Blockchain 101
-----------------

### The DAG structure

<!--The DAG structure allows for the acknowledgement (as per the second point) of multiple blocks. This in turn serves as a “join” operation and allows independent branches be merged into a single branch, thus reducing the time to reach consensus.-->


see [Techspec Theory Blockdag](https://techspec.casperlabs.io/en/latest/theory/naive-blockchain.html#blockdag)
