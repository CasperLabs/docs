Getting started
===============

This guide is intended to support the development of smart contracts on
the CasperLabs blockchain. Content covers what is included in our
CasperLabs contract development kit enabling developers to run smart
contracts in the CasperLabs runtime environment.

- system (Genesis) contracts
- Example contracts - ERC20 example
- Integration tests

You can also use tools you are familiar with to build your contracts and
run them in the engine in the order you desire and so observe the
effects of contract execution in the global state (the shared database
that is the blockchain) -all from within an IDE of your choice.

You can use this guide to install and build dApps to run:

- On our network (DevNet)
- Your network of choice
- Your local environment

Selecting an IDE
----------------
You can choose to use the CasperLabs runtime environment or the environment of your choice.

## Pre-requisites
